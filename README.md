# JavaDataStructures
Level 2 Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 3

Compulsory Task 1
Follow these steps:
● Create a new file called identicalArrays.java
● Write a program that determines whether two arrays are identical.
● Ask the user to enter a number of integer values and store them in an
array
● Then ask the user to enter a second set of integer values and store them
in a different array.
● Now determine whether the two arrays are identical.
● If they are identical print out, “The two arrays are identical”
● If they are not identical print out, “The two arrays are not identical”

Compulsory Task 2
Follow these steps:
● Create a new file called sumElements.java
● Write a program that returns the sum of all elements in a specified
column of a two-dimensional array.
● Firstly ask the user to enter a 3-by-4 array. The user should enter the array
as follows:
2.6 5.1 6 8
5.4 4.4 7 1
9.5 7.9 2 3
● The program should then calculate the sum of each column in the array.
